## CS 132 Web Development

A series of creative web development projects created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend and JavaScript for the backend. 
- **CP1 (Resume/CV)**: A static HTML homepage that introduces the portfolio and provides a link to anthor page displaying the resume. Both pages are static using only HTML and CSS.
- **CP2 (Resume/CV)**: Builds off of CP1 but implements interactive elements using Javascript, including a carousel and click-able cards.
- **CP3 (StarBorn)**: An astology website that will tell users their Star, Moon and Rising signs, given their time of birth, date of birth and place of birth. Using Google Maps's Geocoding API to get the longitude and latitude of the given place, and the Timezone API to determine the timezone, the Astrology API returns the signs for each placement.
- **Final Project (Cowtech)**: An e-commerce website that displays cow products by requesting data from a custom API I developed using Node.js and Express.js. It allows users to interactively filter products by clicking on specific sections of a segmented cow image, view items individually, suggest items, purchase bundles and manage their basket.
